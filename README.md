- 👋 Hi, I’m Aurélie, also known as @Riaulee!
- 👀 I’m passionate about edible plants, forest gardening, and triathlons.

- 💞️ I am currently seeking opportunities in software development after gaining five years of experience in functional and automated testing.

With a strong foundation in testing methodologies and a growing expertise in programming languages and frameworks, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative software projects.
I am particularly interested in joining teams that value creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning in the realm of software development.
